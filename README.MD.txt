This project calculates the angular velocity of my elbow using output from the 2D pose estimator OpenPose. The video was captured on my Samsung Galaxy S21 5G, trimmed using the native camera app, and transferred to my laptop using Google Drive. Once on my laptop, the video was processed using OpenPose and the output video and json files were created. The json files were subsequently used in the resulting calculations.
